## Inspiration
Intrathecal pumps deliver life changing treament to very fragile individuals. Patient safety is crucial for successful use of the pumps and intercommunication between patient and physicians can reduce gaps in information and save lives.

## Our Solution
A centralized information app for physicans to interact and view pateint information on the fly whether an emergency or regular checkup.
In case of an emergency, our app reduces the guessing game and can deliver accurate information to the physican.

## Intr-A-Pump
Intr-A-Pump will provide rich statistics to traveling physicians both online and offline using Google's firebase databases to store information in real time. Patient information as well as alerts are processed and at the specialist's fingertips. Boasting a schedule configuration, our app helps the physician keep on top of his patients needs and various refill schedules.
